Input: nums = [2,3,2,4,3], numsDivide = [9,6,9,3,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The smallest element in [2,3,2,4,3] is 2, which does not divide all the elements of numsDivide.
We use 2 deletions to delete the elements in nums that are equal to 2 which makes nums = [3,4,3].
The smallest element in [3,4,3] is 3, which divides all the elements of numsDivide.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of deletions needed.
